# homework-tracker

Homework Tracker is a Django Project. All that is needed is to go into the directory "homework-tracker/homework-tracker" and the run "python manage.py runserver" in the command line. Once done, the command line will give the user the local server url to go to. From there you can use the website.

# Using the Website

From the homepage, you have the option to click between the tasks and time entries. 

From the task side, you can create, update, and delete tasks using the buttons on the side. In addition to this, there is a button to get to the task dashboard on the left side.

The same applies to the time entries part of the website. On the left are the options to create, update, and delete time entries. The way to get to the time dashboard is also through the button on the left side.
